function plotTracksOrSpotsOverlay(Axes, Tracks, is3d, isTracks, isAlltracks, scalexy, scalez, timepoint, spotSize)
    %Function to plot the tracks on top of the microscopy image. This is purely
    %the plotting functionality to populate the axes object. Further refinement
    %is done in manageTrackOverlayVisualisation.
    %Input: Axes - To plot the track data into
                %Tracks - track data from a localisation software
                %is3d - flag if we plot in 2d or 3d
                %isTracks - flag if we want connected tracks or spots
                %isAlltracks - if we want to show the current tracks for the
                %current frame or all tracks at once
                %scalexy - scaleling value for the tracks to match the microscopy
                %image
                %scalez - scaleling value in z
                %type - if spots or tracks
                %timepoint - if we want single tracks at a given timepoint
    %Output: -
